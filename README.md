## foodsaving worldwide

The [foodsaving worldwide team](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/FSINT/) provides additional resources to build up foodsaving.

## Development goals

Our current development goals are prioritized and written down in our [elaborate roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

We are keeping the features down to a minimum, in order to progressively build up a useful software.

## Releases

Look into our [change log file](CHANGELOG.md) for a quick overview of past versions and recent changes.

### Potential users

Have a look [on the live site](https://karrot.world) for all groups that have registered so far. Not all of them are using the app right now, but we have received feature requests from them.
